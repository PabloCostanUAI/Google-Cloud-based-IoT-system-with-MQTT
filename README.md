# Cloud-based-IoT-system-with-MQTT
![img](./img/schema.png)

This is a project made for the Assignment1 of Internet of Things class at Sapienza University of Rome.
In this assignment I created a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT protocol. I also create a simple web site dashboard to display the data collected from the sensors.
The MQTT is managed using the cloud-based backend of Google IoT platform.

TECHNOLOGY USED: Node.js, MQTT, WebSockets, MongoDB, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS and HTML.
