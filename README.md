# Google-Cloud-based-IoT-system-with-MQTT
![img](./img/testvel.gif)

This is a project made for the Internet of Things class at the Sapienza University of Rome.
It is a cloud-based IoT system that collects information from a set of virtual environmental sensors using the MQTT and MQTT-SN protocol and displays it in a simple web site dashboard.

The MQTT is managed using the cloud-based backend of the Google IoT Core platform.

Technology used: Python, C, RIOT-OS, MQTT-SN, Node.js, MQTT, WebSockets, MongoDB, JQuery, Bootstrap CSS and HTML.
